# My vim setup

## Quick Start 
```
git clone http://github.com/tfiala/vim-setup
cd vim-setup
./setup
```

## Details

The above script will backup any existing .vimrc file and .vim directory in
your home directory to the same with a .bak extension.  It will then overwrite
them with my Vundle-based setup.

## Prerequisites

This setup expects that the host machine has the airline fonts installed
from here:
